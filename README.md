This is a demo of a choose-your-own-adventure style walkthrough of a historical example of contact tracing, where you walk through the streets of London as physycian John Snow during the 1830s cholera outbreak. 

The data is from Robin's blog, here: http://blog.rtwilson.com/john-snows-cholera-data-in-more-formats/

I used CartoDB for the maps, Inky for the game design and HTML and CSS to customize what we wanted. In future iterations, I would just use D3 maps since CartoDB isn't free beyond a point; but for the demo, I could use their free trial.
